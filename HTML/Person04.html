                Autobiography of Amanda
                I was born with an innate curiosity and a passion for learning, which has shaped my journey through life. My experiences have led me to explore various fields, from technology to community engagement, and I have always been driven by a desire to make a meaningful impact on the world around me.
                Currently, I am a first-year university student, delving into the world of JavaScript and programming. My interest in coding extends beyond academics, as I have embarked on various projects, including a Windows Forms spelling and typing game in C#. This project, incorporating game mechanics like a score counter, time constraints, and a high score table, has honed my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of software development.

                <p>
                    Outside of my academic and social pursuits, I have an eclectic mix of hobbies that keep me engaged. I enjoy extreme unicycling, where I challenge myself to navigate rugged terrains on a single wheel.
                    When I’m not pushing my balance to the limit, I spend time training my pet parrot to mimic famous movie quotes, an activity that never fails to entertain my friends and family.
